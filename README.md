### Download from WordPress plugins repository
[SC BXSlider - You can download from the WordPress Plugins Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sc-bxslider/)

Initially, a very simple plugin, with a few options on the administrator panel, for now. 
Otherwise, soon, I'll make it possible. All the options you have on [BX Slider](http://bxslider.com/) you will have in here.


### What is coming next?
 - More options into the plugin's options page
 - Call files and scripts only when necessary
