# SC BXSlider
A slideshow/carousel plugin for WordPress, based on BX Slider

### How to use
1. Make sure you have jQuery installed and working
2. Upload the folder `sc-bxslider` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Create your slider into SC BCSlider post type, created by the plugin
5. Place the shortcode '[sc_bxslider]' wherever you want, in your pages/posts OR place the following code into your php file:
 `<?php echo do_shortcode('[sc_slider]'); ?>` 
4. Enjoy!

Initially, a very simple plugin, without options on the administrator panel. 
Otherwise, soon, I'll make it possible. All the options you have on [BX Slider](http://bxslider.com/) you will have in here.
