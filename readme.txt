A simple slideshow/carousel plugin based on BX Slider

== Description ==

A simple slideshow/carousel plugin based on BX Slider

You can edit several options from the original BX Slider (soon, all those options will be enabled and you will be able to edit)

Very, very, very easy to install, configure and use =D

Last update: Now you can add your own custom css, into the administrator panel

Enjoy! =D

Just:
1. Make sure you have jQuery installed and working
2. Upload the folder `sc-bxslider` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Create your slider into SC BCSlider post type, created by the plugin
5. Place the shortcode '[sc_bxslider]' wherever you want, in your pages/posts OR place the following code into your php file:
 `<?php echo do_shortcode('[sc_slider]'); ?>` 
6. Configure your slider into the administrator panel, if you want
7. Edit your custom css, into the administrator panel (brand new)
8. Enjoy!
